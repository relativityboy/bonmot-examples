    <!--Collections 2 - A slightly different approach to a control handler.-->
  <h1>Example 9.  Collections of Models with Child-Views.</h1>
  <h3>Auto-magic lists of Child Views</h3>
  <p>This example has exactly the same functionality as example 8. The difference is in how it's implemented.</p>
  <p>In 8, the child view, Address.ItemView recieved a click event, and then set its model on the parent-view's
  model.editingAddress. From an event binding perspective it was nice, and the Javascript code was very clear, but setting items
  on the parent-view's model is not a great practice. As a side note, the item view html also wound up being more
  complex, as the entire view needed to be a control</p>
  <p>In 9, we move the control function into the parent-view, and instead take advantage of BonMot's built-in features
  to determine which model to pluck from the list and set in the editingAddress property.</p>
  <p>These two approaches show off different aspects of BonMot's functionality. I'll be using the pattern here for the
    remaining examples. What you do is up to you.</p>
  <p>Choose wisely.</p>

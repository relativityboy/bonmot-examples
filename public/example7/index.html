  <h1>Example 7. Handling nested Models with the same properties.</h1>
  <h3>Edge-cases and taking care of that last 5%</h3>
  <p>This example covers something that is not usually a concern, and is a little difficult to reproduce
    - accidentally binding to a child view's element.</p>
  <p><strong>Why is it unlikely?</strong>
    BonMot uses stickit. Stickit only attaches to the <i>first</i> element it encounters that matches what it's looking
    for. Since BonMot does bindings before Child-Views are even created, elements <i>can't</i> be mis-bound on
    construction.</p>
  <p><strong>So how could it happen?</strong> You have to:
    <ol>
      <li>Create a parent and child-view where their respective models have an attribute with the same name.</li>
      <li>You have to choose to display that attribute in uiBindings for both views</li>
      <li>The HTML for the parent-view must have the element that displays the attribute appear <i>after</i> the
        child-view's display element for its attribute</li>
      <li>You need to set a different model on the parent attribute.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p class="well well-sm ">The way to keep this from never happening is to set <strong>.classSuffix:'*somestring*'</strong> as an attribute of
    your view declaration where *somestring* is unique in the tree of views you create.</p>
  <p>Now on to the trainwreck</p>
  <p>To show you how a parent-view might break itself and child views, and the fix, we have two different Person views,
    a broken one first, and below it a 'fixed' version. The layout HTML is
    the same in both views. Only the class names have been modified. Note the Person's
    <b>name</b> input field is <i>after</i> the Address's <b>name</b> input field. This is necessary to trigger the
    breakage.
  </p>
  <p>To see the first one break, you'll need to switch Person Models from Zero to One, or vice versa. The Address' name
  field will start showing the Person's name value, and though the Person's name input is updated when you change the
  model, it is no longer updated after that.</p>
  <p>The Fixed version works perfectly.</p>
  <p>Please note that for each view, the list of addresses is shared between Persons. This can produce some interesting
  side-effects, but they're only present so you can see the inputs change as expected when switching between Persons.</p>
  <p><strong>In the code:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Address.Model</strong> now has a 'name' attribute. <strong>Address.View</strong> lists 'name' in uiBindings</li>
    <li><strong>Person.View</strong> has <i>ctrlSetPerson</i> to swithch between people.</li>
    <li><strong>Person.ViewFixed</strong> has been added in person.js. Incidentally, this is our first example of
      BonMot's .extend support. The inheriting most of its behavior from <strong>Person.View</strong>, the declaration
      for <strong>ViewFixed</strong> is just three lines of meaningful code with one attribute each.
    </li>
    <li>The template <strong>person_fixed.hbs</strong> has been added, just to put the classSuffix on the binding
      classes.</li>
    <li><strong>app.js</strong> has declarations for our extra persons, and we create both our fixed and broken views
      there.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>BonMot Examples</h1>
  <p>
    With the exception of bootstrap, the examples have been kept as simple as possible for clarity and understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get the most out of these examples, you'll want to have the project open in your editor of choice. All of the code
    specific to the example lives in that example's directory. For the first example, it lives in <i>public/example1</i>.

  <ol>
    <li><a href="example1/index.html">Our first example is super-simple. Two way binding with three data attributes.</a></li>
    <li><a href="example2/index.html">The second example adds a control binding to the first.</a></li>
    <li><a href="example3/index.html">The third example show how we can add functionality & reduce code complexity by leveraging BonMot's native binder.</a></li>

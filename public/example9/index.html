  <h1>Example 9 Collections of Models with Child-Views.</h1>
  <h3>Sorting, Adding, and Removing items from lists.</h3>
  <p>In this example we move from a simple list to a table that sorts when you click a column header. See
    <strong>Person.View.ctrlSortBy</strong>. Clicking on a row in the table will set that model on the Address Detail view.
  </p>
  <p>Also we have <strong>Person.View.ctrlNewAddress</strong> and <strong>Person.View.ctrlDeleteAddress</strong> for
    creating and deleting models.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><b>*BonMot does not yet 'clear' the w-atr-* fields when a model is unset and without a model to replace it.
      For this example, when you hit delete an address model, the address ItemView will disappear from the list on the
      left, but the input fields still display the deleted model's information.<br>
      Clearning this up (no pun intended) is the next feature on the docket. This notice will disappear when that's been implemented.</b><br>
      Meanwhile, the terrible hack of setting an empty model on the view easily cures the symptoms.</i>

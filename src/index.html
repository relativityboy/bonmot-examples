  <h1>BonMot Examples</h1>
  <p>
    With the exception of bootstrap, the examples have been kept as simple as possible for clarity and understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get the most out of these examples, you'll want to follow them in-order, and to have the project open in your editor of choice. All of the code
    specific to the example lives in that example's directory. For the first example, it lives in <i>public/example1</i>.

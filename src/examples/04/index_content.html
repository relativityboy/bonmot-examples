<!-- Create more nicely packaged styles with bon-mot's <strong>unique</strong> attribute. -->
  <h1>{{example_number}} A touch of color. </h1>
  <h3>Modularizing CSS with the 'unique' attribute.</h3>
  <p>
    In this example we do something trivial, but really nice. We've added an attribute 'unique' to our View.
    It's intended to be unique across all the View Types you'll load. What's really neat about this string is that it's
    injected into the root element of your view as a css class (dots are transformed into dashes).
  </p>
  <p>
    This helps you more easily create View specific css and know it'll be applied where it belongs.
  </p>
  <p><strong>In the code:</strong> There's a new css file in the person directory, and two more lines in our person.js file.
    One to import the css, and another for the 'unique' attribute.<br/>
    (you could just as easily include the css via direct link in your page)
  </p>

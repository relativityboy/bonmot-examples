<!--The second example adds a control binding to the first.-->
  <h1>{{example_number}} Buttons are easy</h1>
  <h3>Controls are bound to UI elements via clear, concise, names.</h3>
  <p>We've added a button that shows an hides the input fields. Wiring functionality was as easy as adding the class
    <strong>w-ctrl-toggleEdit</strong> to the button and naming the show/hide function <strong>ctrlToggleEdit</strong>.
    BonMot figures out the relationship and even makes the button element available via <strong>.$ctrl.toggleEdit</strong> off the view
    instance.
  </p>
  <p>As in Example 1 If you edit the input fields, you'll see the large font name update dynamically.</p>

<!-- Low cost, complex, live attributes -->
  <h1>{{example_number}} Low maintenance complex attributes</h1>
  <h3>Creating 'live' html for an attribute without a view. For attributes that need that extra *kick*.</h3>
  <p>This example changes the person.model.addressList yet again. In our previous example it was a Collection of Address Models,
    each with their own view. Here, .addressList is a simple array with JSON describing each address.
    There is an hbs template included in the Persion.View definition at atrViews.addressList. It's used to render the
    address list on change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any attribute can be given an hbs template in this way. If the attribute is an array, the hbs template will be applied
    to each item in the array. Anything with a toJSON function will have that function called, and the results used on
    the template.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again the attribute is rendered <i>in its entirety</i> on change. While convenient, and having lower overhead than
    a view, this rendering method is not suitable for input elements that contain user entered data or state.
  </p>
  <p>We have <strong>Person.View.ctrlNewAddress</strong> and <strong>Person.View.ctrlDeleteAddress</strong> for
    creating and deleting models.<br>
    <i>This shows a development point for BonMot. When a Model is deleted, it needs to be explicitly unset from any parent models.
    The this process will be automatic by version <strong>0.4.0</strong>.</i>

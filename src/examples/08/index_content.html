<!--Child-View Collections - Automagic Lists of Views & Models.-->
<h1>{{example_number}} Collections of Models with Child-Views.</h1>
<h3>Auto-magic lists of Child Views</h3>
<p>Some lists are simple, static, and are well represented by an hbs <strong>#each</strong> statement.</p>
<p>Others lists are much more complex. Collections of models with rich-data, interactivity; lists that might change
order or membership are what we're addressing in this example.</p>
<p>
  This example jumps up quite a bit in complexity as we bring things together. We have a few different views that
  interact in novel ways:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Person.View</strong> This is our 'root' view. It contains all other views.</li>
    <li><strong>Address.DetailView</strong> This view allows you to see and edit the details of an address.</li>
    <li><strong>Address.ItemView</strong> This view appears as many times as there are addresses for the person.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <h3>Keeping display logic out of the Model with templates and the 'bindings' attribute.</h3>
  <p>
    If you've looked at the code in our previous example, you've seen that the model has a function <b>setDisplayName</b>
    on it. In fact, all of the initialize code in the model is about creating and maintaining the displayName attribute.
    </p>
  <p>
    That's fine,
    <span title="Unless your model is a 'View Model' (a model designed specifically to drive one or more kinds of views) best to keep display specific data out of them.">
      but while there are times this can be a good thing</span>, pure data models are best kept lite.
    To do that, we move the displayName driver out of the model an into the view by adding a native stickit binding.
    All of stickit's abilities are available to you if you need them.
    <a href="http://nytimes.github.io/backbone.stickit/">Just follow the stickit documentation</a>. BonMot
    always defers to native stickit bindings; it will respect your choices.
  </p>
  <p><strong>In the code:</strong> You'll see we've cut the total number of lines by four, and improved both readability and
    comprehensibility.(slashes added to give you a visual hint that this is different from our last example)

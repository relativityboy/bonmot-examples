<!--Collections 3 - Sorting Collections of Models with Child-Views. -->
  <h1>{{example_number}} Collections of Models with Child-Views.</h1>
  <h3>Sorting, Adding, and Removing items from lists.</h3>
  <p>In this example we move from a simple html list to a table that sorts when you click a column header. See
    <strong>Person.View.ctrlSortBy</strong>. Clicking on a row in the table will set that model on the Address Detail view.
  </p>
  <p>We have <strong>Person.View.ctrlNewAddress</strong> and <strong>Person.View.ctrlDeleteAddress</strong> for
    creating and deleting models.
